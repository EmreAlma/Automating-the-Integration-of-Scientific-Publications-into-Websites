## Quick Start

### How to Use PubSync

**Starting the Application**

To start the PubSync application, ensure that Java is installed on your computer. To launch the application, depending on your operating system:

1. **Using the Command Line (Recommended for All Systems):**
    - Navigate to the location of the `pubsync-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` file in a terminal.
    - Execute the command: `java -jar pubsync-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
    - This method is universal and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. **Using Double-Click (For macOS and Linux):**
    - Locate the `pubsync-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` file in your file system.
    - Simply double-click the file to start the application.
3. **Using the Script File (For Windows):**
    - For Windows users, the script file (e.g., `script.sh`) is provided in the application directory.
    - Double-click on the script file to launch the application.
    - Ensure that the script file is in the same directory as the `pubsync-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` file.

**Note:** If double-clicking doesn't work, it could be due to Java not being associated with `.jar` files on your system, or the script file not being configured correctly. In such cases, use the command line method.

Upon starting, if there's no existing database file, it will be automatically created in the same directory as the application. This database includes tables for authors and publications, as well as a junction table to manage the association of authors with publications.

#### Accessing the Authors Table

To access the authors table in the database, navigate to the application's port (default is `http://localhost:8080/`) and append the `/ui/authors` path in the browser. Here, authors can be added, updated, or deleted. When adding authors, the start year of their work is mandatory, while the end year is optional; if not provided, the current year is used by default. It's important to enter the author's name exactly as it appears in the DBLP database. In cases where multiple individuals share the same name, DBLP.org assigns a unique 4-digit identifier to each person to distinguish them. Include this identifier when entering the names of such authors.

#### Fetching and Saving Publications

Pressing the "Fetch and Save" button retrieves and saves all publications involving the listed authors, applying certain filters. The first filter selects publications between specified years, while the second ensures that existing publications are not duplicated in the database.

#### Managing Publications

To view, edit, and manage the exportability of stored publications, navigate to `http://localhost:8080/all`. The publications are listed by year as they will appear in the output. New publications are tagged as 'NEW' to distinguish them from existing ones. Each publication has an 'Exportable' checkbox to specify whether it should be included in the output. The "Update" button allows for further editing of publication details.

#### Generating the Markdown File

The markdown file, `_publication.md`, can be generated by clicking the "Generate File" button on the `/ui/authors` page. By default, this file is saved in the application's resources directory. To save it in a different location, enter the desired file path in the provided text box before clicking the generate button. If a file with the specified name exists at the given path, it will be updated; otherwise, a new file will be created.
