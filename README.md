## Automating the Integration of Scientific Publications into Websites: Enhancing Website Functionality

*The Purpose of the Thesis*

This bachelor thesis focuses on automating the integration of scientific publications into our website. Currently, this process is done manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. To address these issues, we will develop a system that automatically extracts and filters publications of the Software Engineering Group from the dblp computer science bibliography. By implementing various filters and configurations, we ensure the relevance and reliability of the collected data. The output generated by our system can be integrated into our website, enhancing its functionality. Additionally, our solution integrates with an existing pipeline, enabling continuous updates. Through automation, we aim to enhance accessibility, reduce manual effort, and minimize errors.
